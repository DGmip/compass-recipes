# TODO
* Create tests for all existing mixins
* Add all pattern mixins from http://leaverou.me/css3patterns
* Add all shadow/drop mixins from http://nicolasgallagher.com/css-drop-shadows-without-images/demo/ and http://www.creativejuiz.fr/trytotry/css3-box-shadow-after-before/
* Add all shapes from http://css-tricks.com/examples/ShapesOfCSS/
* Create automatism to update gh-pages (maybe like sass-recipes does)
* Choose a licence (Do WTF U want licence ?)
